# Developer Docs

Welcome to the Optimism Developer Docs!

Whether you're just looking to [deploy a basic contract](/op-mainnet/getting-started) or you're ready to [build a cross-chain app](/guides/bridging/messaging), you'll be able to find everything you need to start building with Optimism on this page.
If you're trying to figure out how to do something specific, you might search our collection of [tutorials](tutorials) or [suggest a new one](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues).
Or, if you're looking for third-party tools that make building on OP Mainnet easier, check out the [Tools for Developers](/tools/overview) section.

## Where should I start?

### Want to learn more about the OP Stack or Superchain?
The OP Stack is the standardized, shared, and open-source development stack that powers Optimism. It is maintained by the Optimism Collective. We recommend checking out the 
[OP Stack getting started guide](/op-stack/getting-started) to get up to speed.
The Superchain is a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, upgrades, a communication layer and moreâ€”-all built on the OP Stack. For a very quick, high-level overview
of the OP Stack, visit https://app.optimism.io/superchain/. For a more detailed technical guide, we recommend the [Superchain Explainer](/op-stack/explainer).
You can also stay up to date on the Superchain and the OP Stack by subscribing to the [Optimism newsletter](https://optimism.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9727fa8bec4011400e57cafcb&id=ca91042234&f_id=002a19e3f0).

### Looking to get started right away?
We totally understand the need to spin something up quickly, so we've created a few **quick start guides** to get you going. 
- [Quick Start: Run a Node](qs-run-node)
- [Quick Start: Deploy a Dapp](qs-deploy-dapp)
- [Quick Start: Deploy a Chain](qs-deploy-chain)
- Quick Start: Deploy a Contract
The quick start guides are MVPs and won't include configuration information, 
but we will point you to more advanced guides when you're ready.

### Ready to test your application?

The [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) offers developers free testnet ETH for building and testing their applications. Some common use cases include dapp developers and chain operators. 
For example, if you are a dapp developer looking to test transactions or deploy a contract, then you will need testnet ETH tokens to accomplish your task(s). 
Or, if you are a chain operator looking to deploy a chain, then you will need testnet ETH to cover sequencer/batcher fees when writing to L1. Come build with us!

### Ready to deploy a contract? [i think remove this]

Luckily, OP Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), so it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum.
If you're brand new to OP Mainnet, we recommend checking out the [guide to deploying a basic contract](/op-mainnet/getting-started).
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.

For a more detailed tutorial, take a look at the [getting started tutorial](/op-mainnet/getting-started#development-stacks), which contains sample configuration files 
for deploying your contracts from common frameworks like Hardhat, Truffle, and Brownie.

You might also want to check out our guides for [running a local development environment](/op-mainnet/testing/dev-node) or [running your own OP Mainnet node](/getting-started/qs-run-node).
These guides are designed to help you feel totally confident in your OP Mainnet deployment.

### Want to explore the cross-chain frontier?

We've got detailed guides for that.
If you want to bridge a token from Ethereum to OP Mainnet (or vice versa!), you should learn more about our [Standard Token Bridge](/guides/bridging/standard-bridge).
The Standard Token Bridge makes the process of moving tokens between chains as easy as possible.

If you're looking for something more advanced, we recommend reading through our page on [sending data between L1 and L2](/guides/bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, it's pretty cool!
We even dogfood the same infrastructure and use it under the hood of the Standard Token Bridge.

## Still don't know where to look?

If you can't find the content you're looking for, you've got a few options to get extra help.
We recommend first searching through this documentation (search bar at the top right) or reading one of the quick start guides listed above.
If you've already done this and come up short, you can try [asking us a question in Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io) or [making an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues).
