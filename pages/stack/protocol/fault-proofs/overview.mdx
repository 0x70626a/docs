# Fault Proof Overview

The Fault Proof System is comprised of three main components: a Fault Proof Program (FPP), a Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM), and a dispute game protocol.
The system is designed to eventually enable secure bridging without central fallback.
The modular design of the fault proof system lays the foundation for a multi-proof future, inclusive of ZK proofs, and significantly increases the opportunities for ecosystem contributors to build alternative fault proof components to secure the system.

## System Design & Modularity

The Fault Proof System is comprised of three main components: a Fault Proof Program (FPP), a Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM), and a dispute game protocol.
These components will work together to challenge malicious or faulty activity on the network to preserve trust and consistency within the system.
See the video below for a full technical walkthrough of the OP Stack's first fault proof system.

The OP Stack's unique, modular design allows the decoupling of the FPP and FPVM, resulting in the following:

*   development of multiple proof systems, unique dispute games, and a variety of FPVMs in the future.
*   custom-built fault proof systems comprised of any combination of these isolated componentsâ€”including validity proofs, attestation proofs, or ZKVM.
*   dispute games in the dispute protocol backed by multiple security mechanisms.

## Fault Proof Program

The default for this system component is `op-program`, which implements a fault proof program that runs through the rollup state-transition to verify an L2 output from L1 inputs. This verifiable output can then resolve a disputed output on L1.

The program is designed so that it can be run in a deterministic way such that two invocations with the same input data will result in not only the same output, but the same program execution trace. This allows it to be run in an on-chain VM as part of the dispute resolution process.

## Fault Proof Virtual Machine

Cannon is a singular instance of a Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM) that can be used as part of the dispute game for Optimism's (and Base's) optimistic rollup L2 blockchain. 
It supports EVM-equivalent fault proofs by enabling Geth to run onchain, one instruction at a time, as part of an interactive dispute game. Cannon has two main components:
*   Onchain `MIPS.sol`: EVM implementation to verify execution of a single MIPS instruction.
*   Offchain `mipsevm`: Go implementation to produce a proof for any MIPS instruction to verify onchain.

[Cannon](cannon) is the default FPVM used in all disputes. [MIPS](mips) is the alternative FPVM that can be implemented due to the modularity of the dispute game.
