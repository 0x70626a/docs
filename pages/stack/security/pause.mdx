# System Pause Functionality

The OP Stack is, by default, configured to allow a designated `GUARDIAN` address to pause and unpause various L1 smart contracts.
This functionality is designed to be used as a backup safety mechanism in the event of an active pressing security concern.
Keep reading to learn more about this functionality, how it works, and how it can be modified or disabled if desired.

## Overview

The ability to pause certain smart contracts can help mitigate the potential impact of an active security concern.
The OP Stack is designed to allow a designated `GUARDIAN` address to pause and unpause various L1 smart contracts by default.

Pause functionality is managed inside of the `SuperchainConfig` smart contract that is deployed with all OP Stack chains by default.
The `SuperchainConfig` smart contract includes two configuration values that control system pause functionality:

*   `PAUSED_SLOT` is a boolean value indicating whether the system is currently paused.
*   `GUARDIAN_SLOT` is the address of the `GUARDIAN` that can pause and unpause the system.

## Scope

The goal of OP Stack pause functionality is to prevent the execution of invalid withdrawals from a chain's bridge contracts.
The `SuperchainConfig` smart contract currently controls the operation of the following contract functions:

*   `OptimismPortal.proveWithdrawalTransaction()`
*   `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()`
*   `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage()`
*   `StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC20()`
*   `StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC721()`
*   `StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeETH()`

## Shared SuperchainConfig

A chain can choose to subscribe to a `SuperchainConfig` smart contract that is shared by multiple chains.
This allows multiple chains to share the same `GUARDIAN` address and thereby allows the `GUARDIAN` to pause and unpause multiple chains at the same time.
This can be useful for chains that want to share a common security model.
