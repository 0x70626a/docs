# Differences between Ethereum and OP Mainnet

It's important to note that there are various minor discrepancies between the behavior of OP Mainnet and Ethereum.
You should be aware of these discrepancies when building apps on top of OP Mainnet.

## Opcode Differences

| Opcode                                             | Solidity equivalent | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COINBASE`                                         | `block.coinbase`    | Undefined                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `DIFFICULTY`                                       | `block.difficulty`  | Random value. As this value is set by the sequencer, it is not as reliably random as the L1 equivalent. [You can use an oracle for randomness](/builders/tools/oracles#verifiable-randomness-function-vrf).       |
| `NUMBER`                                           | `block.number`      | L2 block number                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `TIMESTAMP`                                        | `block.timestamp`   | Timestamp of the L2 block                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `ORIGIN`                                           | `tx.origin`         | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, then `tx.origin` is set to the [aliased address](#address-aliasing) of the address that triggered the L1 ⇒ L2 transaction. Otherwise, this opcode behaves normally. |
| `CALLER`                                           | `msg.sender`        | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, and this is the initial call (rather than an internal transaction from one contract to another), the same [address aliasing](#address-aliasing) behavior applies.   |
| [`PUSH0`](https://www.evm.codes/#5f?fork=shanghai) | N/A                 | Opcode not supported yet (will be added in a hardfork)                                                                                                                                                            |

<Callout type="info">
  `tx.origin == msg.sender`:
  On L1 Ethereum `tx.origin` is equal to `msg.sender` only when the smart contract was called directly from an externally owned account (EOA).
  However, on OP Mainnet `tx.origin` is the origin *on OP Mainnet*.
  It could be an EOA.
  However, in the case of messages from L1, it is possible for a message from a smart contract on L1 to appear on L2 with `tx.origin == msg.sender`.
  This is unlikely to make a significant difference, because an L1 smart contract cannot directly manipulate the L2 state.
  However, there could be edge cases we did not think about where this matters.

### Accessing L1 information

If you need the equivalent information from the latest L1 block, you can get it from [the `L1Block` contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L1Block.sol).
This contract is a predeploy at address [`0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015`](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015).
You can use [the getter functions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/contracts.html#getter-functions) to get these parameters:

*   `number`: The latest L1 block number known to L2
*   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the latest L1 block
*   `basefee`: The base fee of the latest L1 block
*   `hash`: The hash of the latest L1 block
*   `sequenceNumber`: The number of the L2 block within the epoch (the epoch changes when there is a new L1 block)

### Address Aliasing

<Callout>
  Address aliasing is an important security feature that impacts the behavior of transactions sent from L1 to L2 by smart contracts.
  Make sure to read this section carefully if you are working with cross-chain transactions.
  Note that the `CrossChainMessenger` contracts will handle address aliasing internally on your behalf.
</Callout>

When transactions are sent from L1 to L2 by an Externally Owned Account, the address of the sender of the transaction on L2 will be set to the address of the sender of the transaction on L1.
**However, the address of the sender of a transaction on L2 will be different if the transaction was triggered by a smart contract on L1**.

Because of the behavior of the `CREATE` opcode, it is possible to create a contract on both L1 and on L2 that share the same address but have different bytecode.
Even though these contracts share the same address, they are fundamentally two different smart contracts and cannot be treated as the same contract.
As a result, the sender of a transaction sent from L1 to L2 by a smart contract cannot be the address of the smart contract on L1 or the smart contract on L1 could act as if it were the smart contract on L2 (because the two contracts share the same address).

To prevent this sort of impersonation, the sender of a transaction is slightly modified when a transaction is sent from L1 to L2 by a smart contract.
Instead of appearing to be sent from the actual L1 contract address, the L2 transaction appears to be sent from an "aliased" version of the L1 contract address.
This aliased address is a constant offset from the actual L1 contract address such that the aliased address will never conflict with any other address on L2 and the original L1 address can easily be recovered from the aliased address.

This change in sender address is only applied to L2 transactions sent by L1 smart contracts.
In all other cases, the transaction sender address is set according to the same rules used by Ethereum.

| Transaction Source                                      | Sender Address                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L2 user (Externally Owned Account)                      | The user's address (same as in Ethereum)                           |
| L1 user (Externally Owned Account)                      | The user's address (same as in Ethereum)                           |
| L1 contract (using `OptimismPortal.depositTransaction`) | `L1_contract_address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111` |

## Transactions

### Transaction costs

[Transaction costs on OP Mainnet](/stack/transactions/transaction-fees) include an [L2 execution fee](/stack/transactions/transaction-fees#the-l2-execution-fee) and an [L1 data fee](/stack/transactions/transaction-fees#the-l1-data-fee).

#### EIP-1559

The L2 execution fee is calculated using [EIP-1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq). The cost of a unit of gas is composed of two components:

*   **Base fee**: This fee is the same for all transactions in a block. It varies between blocks based on the difference between the actual size of the blocks (which depends on the demand for block space) and the target block size. When the block uses more gas than the target block size the base fee goes up to discourage demand. When the block uses less gas than the target block size the base fee goes down to encourage demand.
*   **Priority fee**: This fee is specified in the transaction itself and varies between transactions. Block proposers are expected to select the transactions that offer them the highest priority fees first.

The EIP-1559 parameters are different:

| Parameter                             | OP Mainnet value | Ethereum value (for reference) |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------: | -----------------------------: |
| Block gas limit                       |   30,000,000 gas |                 30,000,000 gas |
| Block gas target                      |    5,000,000 gas |                 15,000,000 gas |
| EIP-1559 elasticity multiplier        |                6 |                              2 |
| EIP-1559 denominator                  |               50 |                              8 |
| Maximum base fee increase (per block) |              10% |                          12.5% |
| Maximum base fee decrease (per block) |               2% |                          12.5% |
| Block time in seconds                 |                2 |                             12 |

### Transaction pool (a.k.a. mempool)

As in L1 Ethereum, transactions are stored in a pool until they can be included in a block.
To minimize MEV, Bedrock's mempool is private.
To submit transactions, you will need to configure `op-geth` to forward transactions to the sequencer. This may change in the future.

The sequencer processes transactions in the mempool in order of their base and priority fees.

## Blocks

There are several differences in the way blocks are produced between L1 Ethereum and OP Mainnet.

| Parameter           |            L1 Ethereum | Optimism Bedrock |
| ------------------- | ---------------------: | ---------------: |
| Time between blocks | 12 seconds<sup>1</sup> |        2 seconds |
| Block target size   |         15,000,000 gas |    5,000,000 gas |
| Block maximum size  |         30,000,000 gas |   30,000,000 gas |

(1) This is the ideal.
If any blocks are missed, it could be an integer multiple such as 24 seconds, 36 seconds, etc.

**Note:** The L1 Ethereum parameter values are taken from [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-time).

## Network specifications

### JSON-RPC differences

OP Mainnet uses the same [JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) as Ethereum.
Some additional OP Mainnet specific methods have been introduced.
See the full list of [custom JSON-RPC methods](/builders/node-operators/json-rpc) for more information.

## Contract addresses

The addresses in which various infrastructure contracts are installed are different between L1 Ethereum and OP Mainnet.
For example, [WETH9](https://github.com/gnosis/canonical-weth/blob/master/contracts/WETH9.sol) is installed on L1 Ethereum on [address `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2).
On OP Mainnet the same contract is installed on [address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006`](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006).
