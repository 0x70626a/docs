# Developer tools

Welcome to the OP Mainnet developer tools!

If you are already familiar with [building on OP Mainnet](/op-mainnet/getting-started) and just need the tools to get cracking, you are in the right place!

## Connecting

You have the list of [networks](/op-mainnet/op-networks) and [node providers](/tools/rpc-providers) to help you connect to an Optimism node.

## Deploying

To get some ETH bridged over for deployment gas fees, use one of the available [faucets](/tools/faucets) or just bridge ETH using the [OP Mainnet Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/).

## Monitoring

Your app is live in production? Watch it grow using one of the [monitoring tools](monitoring/overview). We also have a set of [block explorers](monitoring/block-explorers) to help you provide a stellar service to your users.
