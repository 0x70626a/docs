# The OP Stack Client SDK

todo(update internal links):

There are a few areas in which the SDK can help you navigate [the differences between OP Mainnet and Ethereum](/op-mainnet/differences/):

- [Gas costs](/guides/transaction-fees/overview)
- [Interlayer communication](/guides/bridging/basics)

The SDK supports multiple OP Chains: OP, Base, etc.
To see whether a specific OP Chain is supported directly, [see the documentation](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid).
Chains that aren't officially supported just take a few extra steps.
Get the L1 contract addresses, and [provide them to the SDK](/op-stack/build/sdk#contract-addresses).
Once you do that, you can use the SDK normally.
