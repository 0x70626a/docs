# Giving Your Users Free Transactions with Optimism and OpenGSN

[OP Mainnet transactions are cheap](https://optimism.io/gas-tracker).
However, depending on your business model, your users may not have ETH to pay for them at all. 
In this tutorial, you learn how to use [OpenGSN](https://opengsn.org/) to pay for your users' transactions.

In general, doing this requires these tasks:

- Modify your dapp (contracts and UI) to be OpenGSN compatible
- Create and fund a paymaster contract
- Configure a relay (optional)

[Click here for the OpenGSN documentation](https://docs.opengsn.org/).


## Paying for transactions

It would be nice if OpenGSN offered actually free transactions, but that isn't doable.
Instead, OpenGSN shifts the cost from the transaction submitter to [a paymaster](https://docs.opengsn.org/contracts/#paying-for-your-user-s-meta-transaction) contract.
Paymaster contracts are deployed by entities who want to sponsor transactions, for example because the destination is their own application ([see the paymaster we use](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcc6da63d001017ac34bffd35cd24f795014f6a6c)) or because [the transactions come from a user on a whitelist of prepaid users](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/blob/master/packages/paymasters/contracts/WhitelistPaymaster.sol).

OpenGSN provides [multiple prebuilt pay masters](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/tree/master/packages/paymasters).
If none of them fit your needs you can also write your own. 
After you deploy a paymaster just send it ETH, and it'll forward it to the relay hub.
[You can see an example in this transaction](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xdea9ba02b386449af2a05eef42e5e02b421762d4750751c3744a6d34f39b062e). 

When you no longer need the pay master, you can withdraw any remaining ETH using [`withdrawRelayHubDepositTo`](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/blob/master/packages/contracts/src/BasePaymaster.sol#L125-L132).


## Running your own relay

The OpenGSN design assumes that every application runs its own relay, which provides two services:

- Relay the messages of that application at cost (you can specify preferred relays in the GSN configuration)
- Relay the messages of other applications for a profit (exactly how much is determined by the relay administrator).
  On most networks OpenGSN runs a relay that charges a 70% premium.

This way relaying is usually cost free, and the more applications for OpenGSN the more robust the network becomes overall, and therefore the more robust the network access of each application.

[See here for directions to create a relayer here](https://docs.opengsn.org/relay-server/tutorial.html).


## Conclusion

You should now be able to use OpenGSN transactions to enable ETH-less transactions for your users, when your business plan is to monetize them by other means.
