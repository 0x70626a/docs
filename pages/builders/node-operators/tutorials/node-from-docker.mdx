# Running a Node With Docker

Using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is an easy way to run an OP Mainnet node.
This tutorial will walk you through the process of using [`simple-optimism-node`](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node) to run an OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia node using Docker.
`simple-optimism-node` also provides useful tools like a monitoring dashboard and health checking software.
Although less flexible than [running a node from source](./node-from-source) or building your own Docker setup, this is a great way to quickly get started with OP Mainnet.

## What's Included

`simple-optimism-node` includes all the basic components to run an OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia node.
It also includes several additional services to monitor the health of your node and the health of the network you're connected to.
See the [What's Included](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node#whats-included) section of the `simple-optimism-node` README for more details.

## Dependencies

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

Clone the `simple-optimism-node` repository to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node.git
cd simple-optimism-node
```

## Configuration

Configuration for `simple-optimism-node` is handled through environment variables inside of an `.env` file.

<Steps>

{<h3>Create an .env file</h3>}

The repository includes a sample environment variable file located at `.env.example` that you can copy and modify to get started.
Make a copy of this file and name it `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

{<h3>Configure the .env file</h3>}

Open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor.
Set the variables inside of the `REQUIRED (BEDROCK)` section of the file. 
Read the descriptions of each variable to understand what they do and how to set them.
You can also see the [Configure the Node](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node#configure-the-node) section of the `simple-optimism-node` README for more details.

Make sure that the [`NETWORK_NAME`](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node/blob/45672749013e50dd6bbc75d05ce46e4a8b50fd3d/.env.example#L6) variable is set to either `op-mainnet` or `op-sepolia` depending on which network you want to connect to.

<Callout type="info">
You can also set the variables inside of the `REQUIRED (LEGACY)` section of the file if you wish to run an archival OP Mainnet node.
Refer to the `simple-optimism-node` [README](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node#readme) for more information about running legacy OP Mainnet software alongside your OP Mainnet node.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Run the Node

Once you've configured your `.env` file, you can run the node using Docker Compose.
The following command will start the node in the background.

```bash
docker compose --profile current up -d
```

## Operating the Node

You can use Docker Compose to interact with the node and manage the various containers that you started.
Refer to the [Operating the Node](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node#operating-the-node) section of the `simple-optimism-node` README for more information.

## Checking Node Status

`simple-optimism-node` includes a monitoring dashboard that you can use to check the status of your node.
You can access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
Refer to the [Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node#metrics-dashboard) section of the `simple-optimism-node` README for more information.
