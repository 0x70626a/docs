# Preparing for Ecotone Fee Estimation Changes

The proposed Ecotone upgrade to the OP Stack and OP Mainnet changes the formula for estimating the [L1 Data Fee](/stack/transactions/fees#l1-data-fee) component of the [OP Stack Transaction Fee](/stack/transactions/fees) in preparation for the introduction of [EIP-4844](https://eip4844.com) support.
Your application may need to be updated to account for this change.
Read on to learn more about the change and how you can prepare for it.

## Understanding the Change

The L1 Data Fee component of the transaction fee for OP Stack (and therefore OP Mainnet) is expected to change with the proposed Ecotone upgrade.
This new formula is designed to account for the option to post transaction data within data blobs instead of as Ethereum calldata, a feature enabled by [EIP-4844](https://eip4844.com).
Read the [Ecotone Formula](/stack/transactions/fees#ecotone) section of the [Transaction Fees](/stack/transactions/fees) page for more information about the new formula.

## Preparing Your Application

<Callout type="warning">
  Changes to the L1 Data Fee formula may affect your application if you are computing this fee component on your own.
</Callout>
It's strongly recommended that you use [existing tooling](/builders/dapp-developers/transactions/estimates#tooling) to estimate transaction fees instead of computing them yourself.
Refer to the [tooling](/builders/dapp-developers/transactions/estimates#tooling) section of the [Estimating Fees](/builders/dapp-developers/transactions/estimates) page for recommendations on which tooling might be best suited for your application.

If you cannot use existing tooling, use the `getL1Fee` function on the `GasPriceOracle` smart contract to compute the L1 Data Fee component of the transaction fee.
This function would be automatically updated during the proposed upgrade.
Avoid implementing the formula yourself, as it may change in the future.
