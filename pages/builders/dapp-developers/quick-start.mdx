# 15-Minute Quick Start Guide

This 15-min quick start guide walks you thru an easy two-step process to deploy your first OP app.

## Get Test ETH from Superchain Faucet

You'll need some test ETH on OP Sepolia to pay for the [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) associated with deploying your test application.
You can use the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) to get some free ETH on OP Sepolia.

  You can try using [other available OP Sepolia faucets](/builders/tools/build/faucets) instead.

## Build an MVP app with the Starter Kit

The Optimism Starter Kit helps you quickly deploy an OP app. It runs viem under the hood and automatically verifies and publishes contract code to the block explorer for you.

### Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

<Steps>
  {<h3>Get an Etherscan key</h3>}

  *   Register for [Etherscan on Optimism](https://explorer.optimism.io/register). This account is different from your normal Etherscan account.
  *   Go to the [API keys page](https://explorer.optimism.io/myapikey) and click **Add** to create a new API key.

  {<h3>Set up the Environment</h3>}

  You will first need to set up your `.env` to tell Forge where to deploy your contract.

  1.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

      ```sh
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

  2.  Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables.

      *   `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Your Etherscan API Key.

      *   `FORGE_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the network to which you deploy.
          If you use [Alchemy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/ecosystem/alchemy), your URL will look like this: `https://opt-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/<Alchemy API Key>`

      *   `FORGE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the wallet you want to deploy from.

      *   `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: WalletConnect v2 requires a project ID. You can obtain it from your WC dashboard: [https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id)

  {<h3>Start the application</h3>}

  1.  Clone/fork the optimism-starter repo

      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter.git
      ```

  2.  Install the necessary node packages:

      ```sh
      cd optimism-starter
      npm install
      ```

  3.  Start the frontend with `npm run dev`

      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```

      If you get errors during this step, you might need to [update your Foundry to the latest version](#install-foundry).

  4.  Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

      Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/App.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.

</Steps>
