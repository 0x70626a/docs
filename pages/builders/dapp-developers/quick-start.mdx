# 15-Minute Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide walks you thru an easy two-step process to deploy your first OP app.

<Steps>

### Get Test ETH from Superchain Faucet

You'll need some test ETH on OP Sepolia to pay for the [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) associated with deploying your test application.
You can use the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) to get some free ETH on OP Sepolia.

Having issues with the Optimism Superchain Faucet?
You can try using [other available OP Sepolia faucets](/builders/tools/build/faucets) instead.
