/* 
We're still figuring out what the proper approach to adding our designs' to 
Nextra. This file can be a place holder for dropping colors and types so we can
easily implement them.

Notes:
- It seems using nextra's docs theme, locks us into these configurations 
https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration
- Its probably best to use a a custom theme, but this does require a lot more
lift to get the site off the ground
